# Credit-Risk-Classification Report

# Explain the purpose of this analysis:
* The main goal of this examination is to construct and assess the validity of a predictive model which estimates the credit reliability of potential lenders in peer-to-peer lending platforms.

# Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
* Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> Interpreted as the average of the system's sensitivity (recall or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate), leading to an overall balanced prediction precision of 95.2%.
* Precision Score: 92% --> This reflects that out of all positive predictions made, 92% were accurate.
* Recall Score: 95% --> Indicates that the system showed 95% accuracy in identifying actual positive outcomes from all positive predictions.

# Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
* I'd endorse this model to estimate borrowers' credit reliability, primarily due to its remarkable 95% success rate in predicting the repayment status of the initial loan. Such a high level of accuracy could be leveraged to develop a business risk profile, ensuring ample cash flow for lenders to stay operational and generate profits.
